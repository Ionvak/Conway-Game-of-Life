A simple personal implementation of John Conway's Game of Life made for practicing C. 

Build the project by running "make" in the project folder, which generates the executable file "gol".

You can adjust the gof.txt file to set the initial pattern. Setting a cell to 0 initializes it as dead. Setting a cell to anything but 0, e.g. 1, sets it to live. You may change the number of rows in the display to any non-negative integer, however the number of columns is limited to 32.

You can change the update period in the main.c file.
